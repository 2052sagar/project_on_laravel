# project_on_laravel
1. first of all we should create localhost (I prefer xampp)
2. put all this code inside C:\xampp\htdocs\lsapp (lsapp is folder you should create)

# Now you should do certain changes on codes:
1. open lsapp folder in # Visual Studio Code 
2. open .env file
    - change DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD as us have used in localhost
